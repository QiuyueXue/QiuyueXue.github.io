I’m also a visiting faculty researcher at Google XR. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/shwetak" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shwetak Patel</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vikram Iyer</a>. During my PhD, I have interned at Microsoft Research, Apple AI/ML, and Google Health. I got my B.S in Computer Science and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Peking University, and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology.</p> <p>I’m broadly interested in Ubiquitous Computing, Human–Computer Interaction, Wearables, Computing for Health, and novel Sensing Techniques. My recent work focuses on advancing the wearable space by transforming everyday accessories into low-power, intelligent systems that enable applications previously difficult or impossible to achieve. These applications span health, well-being, and human–computer interaction.</p> <p><mark>I will be recruiting PhD students this application cycle</mark>.
