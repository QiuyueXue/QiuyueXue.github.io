I'm an incoming assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science at Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), starting in January 2026. I’m currently a Visiting Faculty Researcher at Google XR. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington, advised by [Shwetak Patel](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/shwetak) and [Vikram Iyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/). I got my B.S in Computer Science and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Peking University, and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Tehcnology.

I’m broadly interested in Ubiquitous Computing, Human–Computer Interaction, Wearables, Computing for Health, and novel Sensing Techniques. My recent work focuses on advancing the wearable space by transforming everyday accessories into low-power, intelligent systems that enable applications previously difficult or impossible to achieve. These applications span health, well-being, and human–computer interaction.

<mark>I will be recruiting PhD students this application cycle</mark>. If you’re interested in working with me, feel free to contact me with your CV.
